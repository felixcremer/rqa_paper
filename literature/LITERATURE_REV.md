# Literature Review of Recurrence Quantification Analysis in remote sensing

The first aim of this review is to see if and how rqa has been used in the analysis of remote sensing data.
The second aim is to get an overview about the themes
that have been analysed with rqa and with that to understand the strength and weaknesses of rqa.

## Recurrence Plots in Remote Sensing
Li_2010

### Marwan_2015

Marwan et al are using 316 MODIS EVI (Enhanced vegetation index) measurements at
a spatial resolution of 250m. They combine 21x21 pixel squares to one recurrence plot.
The find different recurrence plot appearances in Spain compared to Brasil.
They explain these differences with the different vegetatin dynamics in subhumid and semiarid climate.
Why are they combining multiple pixels into one recurrence plot?
What happens when we do this?
