# Introduction
Describe why we do land use mapping

new possibilities with hypertemporal Sentinel-1 data

# Method
   describe Recurrence Plots

   describe Recurrence Quantification Metrics

   describe "normal" multitemporal metrics
 

# Results

Description of study area

Description of the preprocessing

compare RQA metrics histograms to normal metrics

Discuss which metrics can distinguish between which LULC classes

I want to use Kullback-Leibler Divergence for this to quantify the differences in the histograms between the LULC classes for different metrics

# Discussion

Discuss how this information may be used for different applications (e.g. classification)

# Outlook
