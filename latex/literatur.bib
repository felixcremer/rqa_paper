  Abstract                 = {SAR images are subject to degradation by speckle. One of the possible approaches to reduce speckle consists of using the fading diversity of several channels. Now, the stability and repetitivity of satellites promote the obtaining of temporal SAR images which can then be used to improve radiometric resolution. This study presents several algorithms allowing us to filter SLC or multi-looks data. The temporal diversity can also be used during the creation of interferograms with a MMSE vectorial filter. All these algorithms were tested on ERS-1 SAR images and numerical results and filtered images are also presented in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for multitemporal synthetic aperture radar image filtering using three-dimensional (3D) adaptive neighborhoods. The method takes both spatial and temporal information into account to derive the speckle-free value of a pixel. For each pixel individually, a 3D adaptive neighborhood is determined that contains only pixels belonging to the same distribution as the current pixel. Then statistics computed inside the established neighborhood are used to derive the filter output. It is shown that the method provides good results by drastically reducing speckle over homogeneous areas while retaining edges and thin structures. The performances of the proposed method are compared in terms of subjective and objective measures with those given by several classical speckle-filtering methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider the restoration of images with signal-dependent noise. The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated, signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original image is required.},

  Abstract                 = {The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and its complete variant (CEEMDAN) are adaptive, noise-assisted data analysis methods that improve on the ordinary empirical mode decomposition (EMD). All these methods decompose possibly nonlinear and/or nonstationary time series data into a finite amount of components separated by instantaneous frequencies. This decomposition provides a powerful method to look into the different processes behind a given time series data, and provides a way to separate short time-scale events from a general trend. We present a free software implementation of EMD, EEMD and CEEMDAN and give an overview of the EMD methodology and the algorithms used in the decomposition. We release our implementation, libeemd, with the aim of providing a user-friendly, fast, stable, well-documented and easily extensible EEMD library for anyone interested in using (E)EMD in the analysis of time series data. While written in C for numerical efficiency, our implementation includes interfaces to the Python and R languages, and interfaces to other languages are straightforward.},
