## `figs` directory

This is where input figures for the manuscript are stored

This directory also contains a `.gitignore`, for two reasons:
- You don't want to commit most figures since they can be quite voluminous, tend to have many versions and can be quickly generated using the R scripts in `/R/`. Only commit figures which require manual editing. (However, once the paper has been accepted, and before closing the project for long term archiving, it might be worth commiting all the figures).
- The directory could not exist in the remote repository if it was empty

## Content of the `.gitignore`
```
# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except this file
!.gitignore
```
